## üöÄ Deployment Overview

This guide covers deployment procedures for the Bullet Proof project across different environments.

## üåç Environments

### Development
- **Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **Branch**: Feature branches
- **Deployment**: Manual via developer machines
- **Data**: Test data only

### Staging
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and QA
- **Branch**: `develop`
- **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Actions
- **Data**: Anonymized production-like data

### Production
- **Purpose**: Live system
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Deployment**: Automated with manual approval
- **Data**: Real data with full security

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] All tests passing with ‚â•90% coverage
- [ ] Security scans clean (bandit, safety)
- [ ] Type checking passes (mypy)
- [ ] No linting errors (ruff)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Documentation
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] API documentation current
- [ ] Deployment notes prepared
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

### Security
- [ ] Secrets rotated if needed
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] SSL certificates valid

## üîß Deployment Process

### 1. Prepare Release

```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.2.3

# Update version numbers
# Update CHANGELOG.md
# Run final tests
nox -s tests

# Create PR to main
```

### 2. Deploy to Staging

```yaml
# Automated via GitHub Actions
# Triggered by PR to main
# Includes:
- Build verification
- Security scanning
- Deployment to staging
- Smoke tests
```

### 3. Production Deployment

```bash
# After staging validation
# Requires approval from:
- Tech Lead
- Security Officer

# Deployment steps:
1. Create backup checkpoint
2. Deploy new version
3. Run health checks
4. Monitor for 15 minutes
```

### 4. Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify all services healthy
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Review error rates
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Notify stakeholders

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 500ms
- Security violations

### Manual Rollback Process

```bash
# 1. Activate rollback
python scripts/restore_checkpoint.py <checkpoint-id> --force

# 2. Verify restoration
./scripts/verify_deployment.sh

# 3. Investigate issue
# Check logs, metrics, and alerts
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- **Never** commit secrets to repository
- Use environment variables
- Rotate secrets quarterly
- Use secure secret storage service

### Access Control
- Deployment requires MFA
- Least privilege principle
- Audit all deployment actions
- Time-limited credentials

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Checks
- `/health` - Basic health status
- `/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics

### Alerts
- Deployment failures
- Performance degradation
- Security incidents
- Error rate spikes

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Application
APP_ENV=production
APP_VERSION=1.2.3
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<from-secret-manager>
SESSION_TIMEOUT=900
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100

# Database
DATABASE_URL=<from-secret-manager>
DB_POOL_SIZE=20
DB_TIMEOUT=30

# Monitoring
SENTRY_DSN=<from-secret-manager>
METRICS_ENABLED=true
```

### Infrastructure as Code

```yaml
# Example configuration structure
infrastructure/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform/           # Infrastructure definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kubernetes/         # K8s manifests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker/            # Container definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/           # Deployment scripts
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
1. **Identify** - What is broken?
2. **Contain** - Stop the bleeding
3. **Recover** - Restore service
4. **Investigate** - Root cause analysis
5. **Improve** - Prevent recurrence

### Emergency Contacts
- On-call Engineer: [Rotation schedule]
- Tech Lead: [Contact]
- Security Team: [Contact]

## üìù Deployment Logs

All deployments are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Deployer identity
- Version deployed
- Environment
- Success/failure status
- Rollback if performed

> **Note**: Always follow the principle of least surprise. Test thoroughly before deploying.
