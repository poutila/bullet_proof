## 📂 Epic Files (Priority: As Needed)

Epic files are created when tasks exceed 21 story points:

### Template
- **Format**: `epics/E-XXX-epic-name.md`
- **Example**: `epics/E-001-user-authentication-system.md`
- **Note**: Created on demand when epics are identified

---

## 📋 Sprint Archives (Priority: Automated)

Sprint archives are created automatically at sprint boundaries:

### Versioned Task Files
- **Format**: `TASK-v{version}.md`
- **Examples**: 
  - `TASK-v1.0.0.md` (sprint snapshot)
  - `TASK-v1.1.0.md` (major scope change)
- **Location**: `docs/sprint-archives/Sprint-{MM}-{YYYY}/`
- **Note**: Generated by automation workflows

## 🔧 Override Files (Priority: As Needed)

Override files for emergency situations:

1. **`automation-overrides.md`**
   - Purpose: Document automation overrides
   - Created when: Automation needs manual intervention

2. **`emergency-overrides.md`**
   - Purpose: Emergency procedure overrides
   - Created when: Critical incidents require exceptions

3. **`process-overrides.md`**
   - Purpose: Process exception documentation
   - Created when: Standard processes need temporary changes

## 🚀 Creation Strategy

### Phase 1: GitHub Templates (Immediate)
```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE

# Use GitHub's template builder or create from examples
# Templates should follow CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
```

### Phase 2: Epic Directory (When Needed)
```bash
# Create epics directory when first epic identified
mkdir -p epics

# Use epic template from TASK.md documentation
```

### Phase 3: Override Documentation (As Incidents Occur)
- Create override files only when specific incidents require them
- Document the override, reason, duration, and rollback plan

## ✅ Validation

After creating files:
1. Update [DOCUMENTS.md](./planning/DOCUMENTS.md) status from "📝 To Create" to "✅ Current"
2. Run `python scripts/generate_files_required.py` to update file registry
3. Verify all references resolve correctly
