# üìä Reference Validation Report

> Generated: 2025-07-07
> Tool: document_analyzer.reference_validator

## üîç Executive Summary

The reference validator has identified significant issues that need attention:

- **Document Presence**: 58.3% (7/12 referenced documents exist)
- **Missing Documents**: 5 critical documents referenced but not found
- **Path Inconsistencies**: Documents exist but at different paths than referenced
- **Internal Coherence Issues**: 3 documents have broken internal references

## üö® Critical Findings

### 1. Path Inconsistency Issue

The main issue is that documents exist in the `planning/` subdirectory but are referenced without the directory prefix:

| Referenced As | Actual Location | Status |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| `PLANNING.md` | `planning/PLANNING.md` | ‚ùå Path mismatch |
| `TASK.md` | `planning/TASK.md` | ‚ùå Path mismatch |
| `TECHNICAL_REGISTRY.md` | `planning/TECHNICAL_REGISTRY.md` | ‚ùå Path mismatch |

### 2. Missing Documents

These documents are referenced but don't exist:

- `docs/architecture.md` - Referenced in CLAUDE.md
- `epics/E-001-user-authentication-system.md` - Referenced in TASK.md

### 3. Reference Mismatches

#### CLAUDE.md Issues:
- **Missing references to**: `docs/architecture.md`, `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`
- **Has extra references to**: `planning/PLANNING.md`, `planning/TASK.md` (correct paths!)
- **Conclusion**: CLAUDE.md is actually correct - it uses the proper paths

#### DOCUMENT_REFERENCE_MAP.md Issues:
- Uses incorrect paths without `planning/` prefix
- Needs to be updated to reflect actual file structure

### 4. Internal Coherence Issues

#### GLOSSARY.md:
- 6 broken section references (#j, #k, #u, #x, #y, #z)
- These sections don't exist in the document

#### Template Files:
- `TASK-template.md` and `template.md` contain placeholder markers (XXX)

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

1. **Core documents exist**: All main documentation files are present
2. **Most links are valid**: 109 total links found, majority are working
3. **Document structure is logical**: Files are organized in appropriate directories

## üîß Recommended Actions

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority):

1. **Update DOCUMENT_REFERENCE_MAP.md**:
   - Change all references to use correct paths with `planning/` prefix
   - Remove references to non-existent documents

2. **Fix GLOSSARY.md section references**:
   - Either add missing sections or remove broken references

3. **Create missing critical documents**:
   - `docs/architecture.md` (or update reference to `docs/architecture/README.md`)

### Medium Priority:

1. **Clean up template placeholders** in TASK-template.md and template.md
2. **Standardize path references** across all documents
3. **Add validation to CI/CD** to catch future reference issues

## üìà Progress Tracking

- [x] Reference Map Validation completed
- [ ] Path inconsistencies need fixing
- [ ] Missing documents need creation or reference updates
- [ ] Internal coherence issues need resolution

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Fix DOCUMENT_REFERENCE_MAP.md to use correct paths
2. Update broken section references in GLOSSARY.md
3. Decide whether to create missing documents or update references
4. Add automated reference validation to CI pipeline
